# IBM-Watson

Created a travel & fashion chat bot app using IBM Bluemix and Android. 

Created a digital wardrobe which is the collection of all the clothes that one has, along with some of its properties like cloth type etc. Given a travel destination and duration it should be able to suggest you clothes to take. Building this will involve weather APIs along with some visual recognition APIs.

## Todo

1. To integrate a feature to upload in the app by using camera or uploading from the SD Card. 
2. To implement a chat UI.
3. Improvement of Image Classification 
4. User Experience in giving the inputs.

## APIs or Services or Technologies Used:

1. Conversation 
2. Visual Recognition 
3. Speech to Text (Todo)
4. Android SDK

## Result

Needed to focus on UI. Working only in logs. Needs to work more on the Image classification. Need to be implemented good UI.
